I did this blog to improve my skills with PHP.
I am trying to learn more about it. I am using a book to learn PHP and I am trying to practice what I have learned by doing
projects. I am trying to make a simple web application that allows users to create and manage their own to-do lists. 
I am using a MySQL database to store the data.

DB schema in project.
